- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
        	An employer may ask you to use class components, also projects you are added to might use them, so itâ€™s important to know how. 

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
        	The three lifecycle methods are componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. During the mounting phase, you would use componentDidMount. This indicates that the stuff inside that method will render when the program first starts up. componentDidUpdate is used when something on the application needs to re-render, such as a change handler. componentWillUnmount is used when the component is removed from the screen.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
        	Custom hooks let you build a piece of code that can be used many times over in the same application. It helps you keep your code DRY and readable.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
        	Testing is important because it helps you find bugs and errors along the way, rather than at the end when it would be costly and take a lot of time to fix. It also helps those who may be working on your code later to know what the intent was, so they can avoid breaking it when they add/change things.
